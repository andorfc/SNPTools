    ['Where does the data come from?',
     'A query sends your region and accession list to the server, which reads the real HDF5 variant store, writes a VCF for exactly that slice, and returns it. The tools parse that VCF into the tables and matrices you see, so everything downstream is one consistent result.'],
    ['How do I move a selection between tools?',
     'Run a query in SNPVersity, then use "Send selection to…" in the top bar (or the buttons on a result). The same genotype matrix is handed to SNPImpact, SNPCompare, SNPTree, SNPMatrix, and SNPTrait without re-querying. SNPMatrix and SNPTree can also pass their set on to each other.'],
    ['Why did a wide region give me a download instead of a table?',
     'Regions larger than one million bases skip the in-browser table and return a downloadable VCF instead, so the page stays responsive. Narrow the interval to get the interactive table back.'],
    ['Why are some cells \u2014 or N/A?',
     'A \u2014 in a domain column means Pfam annotation for that position hasn\u2019t been loaded yet. Blank second-generation scores (PlantCAD2, ESM2, ESM3) mean the dataset is not MaizeGDB 2026 — only that family carries them. MQ and coverage read N/A when the source didn\u2019t record them.'],
    ['Is there a limit on how many accessions I can compare?',
     'The distance tools warn before doing very large computations in the browser: SNPTree above 250 accessions and SNPMatrix above 400. You can build anyway, it just may be slow. SNPImpact renders up to 1,500 variants at a time.'],
    ['What can I download?',
     'A VCF from SNPVersity; a CSV distance matrix, PHYLIP, PNG, and SVG from SNPMatrix; Newick, MEGA, and PHYLIP trees from SNPTree. Comparison and impact tables can be exported from their own pages.'],
    ['Which tools are ready to use now?',

        <summary><b>MaizeGDB 2026 dataset: composition, processing, and scale</b><span class="hp-chev">${ico('caret')}</span></summary>
        <div class="hp-data-body">
          <p>The MaizeGDB 2026 resource combines public whole-genome resequencing from <b>2,710 maize accessions</b>, including diverse inbred lines, landraces, teosintes, association panels, NAM founders and related materials, and several historically important samples. All reads were processed through a standardized variant-calling workflow against <b>B73 RefGen_v5</b>, so coordinates, reference alleles, gene models, and downstream annotations use one common reference system.</p>

          <h3>How the two MaizeGDB 2026 datasets differ</h3>
          <div class="hp-comparegrid">
            <div class="hp-dcard"><b>High Coverage</b><p>Contains approximately 290 million loci that passed mapping-quality and genotypic-coverage requirements. This version retains broader variation and is useful when sensitivity and variant discovery are the main goals.</p></div>
            <div class="hp-dcard"><b>High Quality</b><p>Contains approximately 98 million loci. It applies the same mapping-quality and coverage filters plus an additional high-confidence linkage-disequilibrium criterion. This more conservative set is useful when specificity and confidence are priorities.</p></div>
          </div>
          <p class="hp-fine">“High Coverage” describes the broader filtered set; “High Quality” is the stricter subset. A locus count refers to a genomic variant position in the complete dataset, not the number of rows returned for a particular region or accession selection.</p>

          <h3>What is stored and displayed</h3>
          <p>The underlying resource is maintained in VCF and HDF5 forms. SNPVersity sends the selected dataset, genomic interval, and accession list to the server, which extracts the requested slice and returns a VCF. SNPTools then reuses that same genotype matrix in SNPImpact, SNPCompare, SNPTree, SNPMatrix, and related pages. Each site may include REF and ALT alleles, accession genotypes, predicted molecular consequence, gene association, mapping quality, genotype completeness, linkage-disequilibrium support, allele frequency, Pfam domain context, and DNA- or protein-language-model scores when available.</p>

          <h3>Source projects</h3>
          <p>The panel was assembled from multiple public projects rather than one experiment. This increases biological and geographic diversity, but it also means sequencing depth, library preparation, and project design can differ among accessions. The standardized alignment, calling, and filtering workflow reduces—though does not completely remove—these study-to-study differences.</p>
          <div class="hp-tablewrap"><table class="hp-table hp-compact">
            <thead><tr><th>Accessions</th><th>BioProject</th><th>Project or population</th><th>DOI</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>${projects}</tbody>
          </table></div>

          <h3>Variant-effect composition</h3>
          <p>Most loci are intergenic because much of the maize genome lies outside annotated coding regions. Coding and gene-associated categories are much smaller but are especially important for SNPImpact, SNPFunction, and SNPFold. “Stop-related” summarizes variants annotated in the source statistics as stop effects; the exact transcript-level consequence shown in a result may be more specific.</p>
          <div class="hp-tablewrap"><table class="hp-table hp-compact">
            <thead><tr><th>Effect category</th><th>High Coverage</th><th>High Quality</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>${effects}</tbody>
          </table></div>

          <h3>Distribution by chromosome</h3>
          <p>Variant counts broadly track chromosome length, although local diversity, repetitive sequence, mappability, selection, and the composition of the accession panel also affect density. “Raw” is the pre-filter total reported in the source summary; the two filtered columns show the successive retained sets.</p>
          <div class="hp-tablewrap"><table class="hp-table hp-compact">
            <thead><tr><th>Chromosome</th><th>Length (bp)</th><th>Raw variants</th><th>High Coverage</th><th>High Quality</th></tr></thead>

          </table></div>

          <h3>Important interpretation notes</h3>
          <ul class="hp-notes">
            <li><b>Reference-relative calls:</b> REF and ALT are defined relative to B73 v5; “alternate” does not mean rare, harmful, or derived.</li>
            <li><b>Accessions are not all independent:</b> some projects include replicates, related lines, founders, or multiple runs. Project and accession metadata should be considered when interpreting similarity.</li>
            <li><b>Missingness varies:</b> genotype completeness can differ by site and accession. Pairwise tools exclude sites where either member lacks a usable call.</li>
            <li><b>Consequence is transcript dependent:</b> one genomic variant may receive several annotations when it overlaps multiple transcripts; interfaces generally display the most severe or most relevant consequence.</li>
            <li><b>Model scores are predictions:</b> PlantCAD and ESM scores prioritize candidates but do not establish biological causality. Use them together with frequency, consequence, domain, structure, phenotype, and experimental evidence.</li>
            <li><b>Counts can differ slightly among summaries:</b> totals generated at different pipeline stages or from differently normalized records may vary by a small number of sites. The live dataset metadata and downloadable files are authoritative for an analysis.</li>
